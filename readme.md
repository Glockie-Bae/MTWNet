In this paper, we present GLMS as a powerful framework for industrial and benchmark time series analysis, which can

üèÜ Achieve state-of-the-art performance on both the industrial spot welding dataset and the UEA2018 benchmark datasets.

üåü Overcome the limitations of non-periodic time series analysis by decomposing sequences into global trends and local fluctuations, thereby compensating for the lack of explicit periodic information.



## Global Trend and Local Fluctuation Modeling Strategy 

Most time series methods rely on trend‚Äìseasonality decomposition, but industrial production data are multi-stage and usually non-periodic. GLMS tackles this by using adaptive windows to capture potential temporal dependencies, overcoming the limitations of existing methods on non-periodic data.

## Get Started

1. Install requirements. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
2. Download data. You can download UEA2018 datasets from [Time Series Machine Learning Websitr](https://www.timeseriesclassification.com/index.php)
 > The  industrial spot welding dataset is available upon request from the corresponding author (zrj22127@gmail.com
).
3. Train the model. We provide the experiment scripts of all benchmarks under the folder `./scripts`. You can reproduce the experiment results by:

## Main Results
We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of GLMS, covering classification and short-term forecasting, including 28 UEA real-world and 6 real-world forecasting benchmarks.
**üèÜ GLMS achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance in all benchmarks**, covering a large variety of series with different frequencies, variate numbers and real-world scenarios.
